# Customer Segmentation

## Motivations:
Customer segmentation is the fundamental basis of recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and retention. Clustering customers help to identify users with similar behaviors, patterns or beliefs which helps companies provide accurate personalized services for the differnt kinds of customers. Clustering not only aids in providing a seamless experience for the users, but it also helps companies identify opportunities for growth and investment, as well as to distrubute resources according to each identified group.

For this project we are going to use K-Means clustering, with marketing data from kaggle to create customer segmentation clusters.
