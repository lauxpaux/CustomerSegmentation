    "### Motivations: \n",
    "Customer segmentation is the fundamental basis of recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and retention. Clustering customers help to identify users with similar behaviors, patterns or beliefs which helps companies provide accurate personalized services for the differnt kinds of customers. Clustering not only aids in providing a seamless experience for the users, but it also helps companies identify opportunities for growth and investment, as well as to distrubute resources according to each identified group.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we are going to use K-Means clustering, with marketing data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign) to create customer segmentation clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Clustering:\n",
    "Clustering can be done in different ways, depending on business intentions and motivations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geographic segmentation:** Clustering customers based on location. Can be used for projects such as identifying traffic patterns or identifying highest grossing products based on location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demographic segmentation:** Clustering individuals by personal similarities and motivations. For example, you clustering individuals who regularly purchase diapers as parents vs those who do not as non-parents. Other examples include identifying the age and gender of the most loyal costumers, which can then help focus initiatives on retaining those customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Psychographic segmentation:** Clustering individuals based on interests, beliefs and values. This can mean grouping individuals with similar taste in music, running patters or clothing brands.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Behavioral segmentation:** Clustering individuals based on their habits or actions such as app-usage or store-visit patterns. Can be used to identify involvement and sense of loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Needs-based segmentation:** Clustering individuals based on needs. For example, grouping customers that require home delivery options as a must-have.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Value-based segmentation:** Clustering customers based on their spending patterns, revenue and loyalty spending for the company. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Technographic segmentation:** Clustering individuals by the way they use and access technology to reach services, or buy products. For example, identifying those that use desktop, mobile or external applications to complete transactions or access services. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "Below we explore the different columns in the data and also group them into the different cluster-types we can formulate from the columns. \n",

    "NumWebVisitsMonth: Number of times the customer visited the store in the last month<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behavioral segmentation:\n",
    "The following columns identify the customer's acceptance to advertisement campaigns, 1 if yes, 0 if not\n",
    "AcceptedCmp1: Customers who accepted campaign's first attempt  <br>\n",
    "AcceptedCmp2: Customers who accepted campaign's second attempt <br>\n",
